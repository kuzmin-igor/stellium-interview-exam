# Introduction 
In order to test your development competencies and knowledge, you have been given a small project to fix. 
It is a .NET core – React application that insert and retrieves data from a local Azure CosmosDB instance. 
The project can be run entirely locally. 
The front-end application calls an API method on the backend that will retrieves an item on the database and return it to the front-end application. The content will be then displayed on the page.
It was working correctly until now, but for some reason it doesn’t anymore. You must investigate!

# Getting Started
Here are the prerequisites that you need to install on your machine for the project to work:
-	Visual studio 2019 (With web development features)
-	Node.js (Latest)
-	Cosmos DB emulator
